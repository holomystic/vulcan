You are a translator and crewmen on the ship <b>The Marquesa</b> looking for resources on the newly discovered Americas coast. You leave behind a life of living as a loner and the lack of romantic success that it brought. 

You consider yourself a pervert internally but come off as someone with social issues.

After weeks at sea you approach the intended coast in search for claiming a stake of land for your country. During the approach, your boat ends up capsizing due to a terrible storm throwing your crew overboard and leaving you near death.
Your body meanders into shore during the morning after the large storm.
A local tribe finds you while pillaging the wreck and takes you back to their village to nurse your injuries and determine who you are.
You awaken days later to a council of amazonian women standing around speaking in a foreign dialect. 
Your mission is to somehow communicate with this tribe to see what life you have left to salvage and to somehow determine where you are and the status of your other crew members.

All of the council members and tribes people are beautiful. One smaller woman is deemed an outcast by her peers due to her small stature. You develop some feelings toward her over time.

Once you are able to somewhat communicate with the tribe you learn of reason why there are only amazonian women and about the incoming doom that threatens your and their existence. You are on an island with an active volcano that could explode at any moment with no other habitable land in sight from the coast.

You must use the resources you have and your 1576 brain to help you save your new harem and get off the island before its inhabitants are wiped out!
